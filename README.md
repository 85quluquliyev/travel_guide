## Project Purpose

The main purpose of the project is to offer special guidance services to tourists coming from abroad and make these services accessible through an online platform. This way, tourists can plan their trips more safely and easily, while guides can reach a wider audience with their services.

## Goals and Benefits

- **For Tourists**: Easy access, reliable guides, fast booking, and cancellation processes.
- **For Guides**: A wider customer base, the opportunity to promote themselves, and regular booking tracking.
- **General Benefits of the Platform**: User-friendly interface, secure payment options, continuous improvement through customer and guide feedback.

## User Types and Registration Processes

There are two main user types in our project: Tour Guides and Travelers.

- **Tour Guides**: They can create their profiles, specify their languages and experiences, and promote their services.
- **Travelers**: They can search for guides, review profiles, and make bookings.

## Profile Management

Users can update their profiles whenever they want. Tour guides can specify their languages and experiences to better promote themselves. This feature ensures that users are more active and interactive on the platform.

## Guide List and Booking

- **Guide List**: Travelers can view the guide list and reserve guides. Guides can improve themselves with user comments and ratings.
- **Booking**: Travelers can reserve guides and track their booking status. Guides can view and manage their booking status.

## Booking Management

- **Booking Cancellation**: Travelers can cancel their bookings. Guides can also update their booking status.
- **Booking Tracking**: Both user types can track their bookings and view their past bookings.

## Technologies Used

- **Backend**: Django (Python)
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, Bootstrap
- **Database**: SQLite (During development)
- **Testing**: Django Test Framework
- **Version Control**: Git

## Project Requirements

- **Functional Requirements**: User registration and login processes, profile creation and updating, guide listing and searching, guide booking and cancellation, booking management and viewing.
- **Non-Functional Requirements**: Performance, security, usability, scalability, and ease of maintenance.
